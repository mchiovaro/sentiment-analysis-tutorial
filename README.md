# sentiment-analysis-tutorial

## Description
In this repo, you will find tutorials on how to conduct sentiment analysis in
R (and soon Python). The packages used identify various sentiment values of text data, including the compound valence score, positive frequency weighting, neutral frequency weighting, and negative frequency weighting.

## Scripts

vader.Rmd: This tutorial is original work by @mchiovaro. and uses the vader package for sentiment analysis. No external data is needed for this tutorial.

tinytext.R: This tutorial was created by @rtatman at Kaggle, and uses tinytext for sentiment analysis. It is included here to demonstrate an alternative way of conducting the analysis without using the 'vader' package.

## Data

Data in the *archive* file (used in the tinytext.R tutorial) are State of the Union address transcripts downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/tutorial-sentiment-analysis-in-r.
